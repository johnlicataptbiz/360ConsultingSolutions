# Implementation Plan - BentoServices "Elite Matrix" Overhaul

The "Our Expertise" section currently feels like a standard list of benefits. We need to transform it into a **Strategic Matrix** that feels like a high-logic command center for elite performance.

## Design Goals
- **Immersive Grid**: Break away from the 1/3-2/3 layout into a dynamic Bento Grid.
- **Technical Aesthetic**: Incorporate SVG "Logic Schematics" and "Radar" animations to emphasize the 30 years of retail logic.
- **Micro-Data**: Add specific performance metrics/logic points to each card (e.g., "30Y Scale Logic", "Trajectory Mapping").
- **Premium Glass**: Use high-blur backgrounds and thin, pulsing borders.

## Tasks
1. **Structural Redesign**: Create a responsive 6-column grid system for desktop.
2. **Component Logic**:
    - **Header**: Large, centered, dramatic typography.
    - **Business Matrix (Wide)**: Focus on "Scaling Frameworks".
    - **Career Matrix (Tall)**: Focus on "Executive Presence & Velocity".
    - **Life Matrix**: Focus on "Legacy & Balance".
    - **The 360 logic (Small)**: A technical "Connection" card.
3. **Animations**: 
    - Implement "Scanline" hover effects.
    - Floating technical badges (Pills) that react to mouse movement.
4. **Visual Assets**: Generate an abstract "Strategic Logic" SVG background for the entire section.

## Verification
- High-fidelity visual check across mobile and desktop.
- Interactive hover testing for "Logic Activation" feel.
- Performance audit (ensuring SVGs/Animations don't lag).
